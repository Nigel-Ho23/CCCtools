# CCCtools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CCCtools is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of CCCtools:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("Nigel-Ho23/CCCtools")
```


## Example data

`NL` is a Seurat object created from the example dataset in the the CellChat tutorial. See the `create_NL.R` script in data-raw folder.



```{r example}
library(CCCtools)

hello("Nigel Ho")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
