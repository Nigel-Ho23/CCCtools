\arguments{
\item{obj}{Seurat object with normalized counts in the data layer of the RNA assay}

\item{labels}{Metadata column name of cell type annotations}

\item{toKeep}{Value within the metadata column of interest to retain for the analysis. This field is mandatory if group is not NULL. (default = NULL)}

\item{use_dir}{Input files required to run CellPhoneDB and the output files from the analysis are created and saved to a temp file (default). Should users desire to have these files be stored in their personal directories, they may input their filepath to this argument.}

\item{...}{Takes in any arguments from c("iterations", "threads", "debug_seed", "result_precision", "subsampling_num_pc", "subsampling_num_cells") for user customization, else running on the default values for these paramters. See Value below for link to description by CellPhoneDB}
